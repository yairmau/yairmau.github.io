But, in practice, there is.<br><strong>— Jan L. A. van de Snepscheut</strong></div>\n```\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">Theory is when you know everything but nothing works. Praxis is when everything works but no one knows why. In our lab, theory and praxis are combined: nothing works and no one knows why.<br><strong>— Unknown</strong></div>\n```\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\">The great tragedy of Science — the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact.<br><strong>— Thomas Henry Huxley</strong></div>\n```\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"alert alert-light\">So, in the face of overwhelming odds, I’m left with only one option, I’m gonna have to science the shit out of this.<br><strong>— Mark Watney</strong></div>\n```\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"alert alert-success\">The fact that we live at the bottom of a deep gravity well, on the surface of a gas covered planet going around a nuclear fireball 90 million miles away and think this to be normal is obviously some indication of how skewed our perspective tends to be.<br><strong>— Douglas Adams, The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time</strong></div>\n```\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"alert alert-danger\">Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful.<br><strong>— George E. P. Box</strong></div>\n```\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\">An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.<br><strong>— Niels Bohr</strong></div>\n```\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">An expert is one who knows more and more about less and less until he knows absolutely everything about nothing.<br><strong>— Nicholas Butler</strong></div>\n```\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\">Just as there are odors that dogs can smell and we cannot, as well as sounds that dogs can hear and we cannot, so too there are wavelengths of light we cannot see and flavors we cannot taste.

I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you’ve never actually known what the question is.”<br>\n”But it was the Great Question! The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything!” howled Loonquawl.<br>\n”Yes,” said Deep Thought with the air of one who suffers fools gladly, ”but what actually is it?”<br>\nA slow stupefied silence crept over the men as they stared at the computer and then at each other.<br>\n”Well, you know, it’s just Everything … Everything … ” offered Phouchg weakly.<br>\n”Exactly!” said Deep Thought. ”So once you do know what the question actually is, you’ll know what the answer means.”\n<br><strong>— Douglas Adams, The Hitchiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</strong></div>\n```\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"alert alert-danger\">Computers are useless.

Not \"simple” in the sense that the homework problems are easy, but simple in the sense that Galileo's trick of ignoring friction and air resistance makes our lives easier. The reason why physics classes seem so hard is not because physics is so hard—it's because we understand so much of it that there's a lot to learn, and that's because it's fundamentally pretty simple.\n<br><strong>— Sean Carroll, The Big Picture</strong></div>\n```\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\">Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better.<br><strong>— Edsger W. Dijkstra</strong></div>\n```\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"alert alert-light\">The fundamental role of a teacher is not to deliver information. It is guide the social process of learning. The job of a teacher is to inspire, to challenge, to excite their students to want to learn. Yes, they also do explain and demonstrate and show things, but fundamentally that is beside the point. The most important thing a teacher does is make every student feel like they are important, to make them feel accountable for doing the work of learning.<br><strong>— Derek Alexander Muller, https://youtu.be/GEmuEWjHr5c</strong></div>\n```\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"alert alert-success\">What is the first business of one who practices philosophy?

We use them because they are less precise and thus less vulnerable to be misled by noise. A good heuristic is to distrust whoever adds or requires unnecessary precision. Another good heuristic is to distrust whoever thinks that precision always correlates with correctness.<br><strong>— Luca Dellanna, https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca/status/1287644735016927234</strong></div>\n```\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">Let no one ignorant of geometry enter here.<br><strong>— Said to be engraved on the door of Plato's Academy, the oldest recorded entrance requirement of a college</strong></div>\n```\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\">The comments aren't there to explain the code to the programmers, the code is there to explain the comments to the computer.<br><strong>— Andy Harris, How to begin thinking like a programmer, https://youtu.be/YWwBhjQN-Qw?t=1165</strong></div>\n```\n\n\n",
