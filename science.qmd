## Heatwave impact on plants

How resilient can plants be to severe heatwaves?

::::
:::

A warming climate means higher climatic variability, including harsher heatwave events.
Severe heatwaves impose great stress on plants, increasing the risk of desiccation and, ultimately, hydraulic failure.

Guiding questions:

* What is the relative impact of soil drought and atmospheric drought on plant functioning?
* How important are water storages (internal and in the soil) in maintaining transpiration and cooling?
* How do plant resilience and survival chances depend on plant traits?

We investigate these questions through field and lab experiments with native Mediterranean species, continuously monitoring water fluxes and plant status.
We analyze the data using time-series tools and machine-learning techniques.
Through mathematical modeling, we investigate plant response to expected future climate.
