    "text": "Talks\nA scientific talk is not a scientific paper, it is a completely different medium! Here are a few tips that I find useful.\nHow To Give a Talk\n[How To Give a Talk, by David L Stern.]\nExcerpt:\n\nPrinciple 1 - Don’t Put Words On Slides\nIt may not seem intuitive, but including words on slides has a bigger detrimental effect on the quality of a talk than any other issue I will address.\n\n\nThe slides in most science talks contain many words. This simple fact has many consequences, none positive. Most obviously, words on slides impel listeners to read the words on the slide. If you are talking while they are reading, then you generate cognitive dissonance that makes it difficult for the audience to understand either your spoken words or your written words. So, if you want your audience to read the words on a slide, then, presumably, you should shut up. But, I don’t recommend that. Instead, just cut all the words form your slides.\n\nThe David Attenborough Style of Scientific Presentation\n[The David Attenborough Style of Scientific Presentation.]\nExcerpt:\n\nGet into this mindset: your main job is to be an entertainer, not a scientist. Most scientists don’t do this, which is why most scientific talks are bad. The fact of the matter is that if the audience doesn’t understand and enjoy your talk, they won’t care if your science is good.\n\nA LaTeX template\nCheck out a nice LaTeX template for presentations [here].\n\nVisualizations\nVisualizations can take a message very, very far. I put a lot of thinking into how to best express an idea. I believe that great graphs greatly improve a scientific paper, and a thoughful graph/animation surely brings home the main point of a talk. Here are a few thoughts on visualizations.\nInspiration\n\nHans Rosling, Gapminder\nMax Roser, Our World in Data\nStephen Malinowski, Music Animation Machine\nThe Economist, Daily Chart\n\nColors\nDon’t use the rainbow color map.\nWhy? [Read this], by Robert Kosara.\nSo how should you choose the colors for a graph?\n\nVisit colorbrewer. It gives sequential, diverging and qualitative colormaps that can be chosen to be “colorblind safe”, “print safe”, or “photocopy safe”. Usually, it is the first and only tool I use. It’s just great!\nVisit Adobe Color CC. It gives you much more freedom to play with the colors than colorbrewer. Use it wisely!\n\nMore on color: read Subtleties of Color, by Robert Simmon.\nBrowse for ideas\n\nThe Data Visualisation Catalogue"

    "text": "Heatwave impact on plants\nHow resilient can plants be to severe heatwaves?\n\n\n\nA warming climate means higher climatic variability, including harsher heatwave events. Severe heatwaves impose great stress on plants, increasing the risk of desiccation and, ultimately, hydraulic failure.\nGuiding questions:\n\nWhat is the relative impact of soil drought and atmospheric drought on plant functioning?\nHow important are water storages (internal and in the soil) in maintaining transpiration and cooling?\nHow do plant resilience and survival chances depend on plant traits?\n\nWe investigate these questions through field and lab experiments with native Mediterranean species, continuously monitoring water fluxes and plant status. We analyze the data using time-series tools and machine-learning techniques. Through mathematical modeling, we investigate plant response to expected future climate.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlant optimal control\nHow can plants best regulate gas exchange, maximizing carbon uptake while minimizing water losses?\n\n\n\nIn order to make photosynthesis, plants capture CO2 from the atmosphere through the pores in their leaves (stomata). However, at the same time that CO2 enters the plant, water vapor exits. If too much water leaves the plant, it will desiccate and die, so the plant should keep its stomata mostly closed. On the other hand, the plant will starve from lack of carbon if it doesn’t open its stomata. We apply the tools of optimal control theory to study this fascinating problem.\nGuiding questions:\n\nWhich plant traits produce different water management strategies (e.g. isohydricity)?\nWhat is the plant really optimizing for? Instantaneous carbon assimilation? Maximum carbon gains over long periods? Fitness?\nHow do plants respond to stochastic environmental conditions?\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFruit-tree water stress\nCan we minimize water stress with smart irrigation scheduling? Can we do it optimally?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSoil salinization\nHow can we ensure healthy soils for generations to come?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSoil compaction\nWhat are the soil physical changes that follow compaction? How do they affect water and solute dynamics, and ultimately soil degradation?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the first business of one who practices philosophy? To get rid of self-conceit. For it is impossible for anyone to begin to learn that which he thinks he already knows.\n— Epictetus"

But elementary does not mean easy to understand. Elementary means that very little is required to know ahead of time in order to understand it, except to have an infinite amount of intelligence. There may be a large number of steps that hard to follow, but to each does not require already knowing the calculus or Fourier transforms.— Richard P.

It is to be hoped that the features retained for discussion are those of greatest importance in the present state of knowledge.— Alan Turing, The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\nProblems worthy of attack prove their worth by hitting back.— Piet Hein\nArt is solving problems that cannot be formulated before they have been solved.

Not \"simple” in the sense that the homework problems are easy, but simple in the sense that Galileo's trick of ignoring friction and air resistance makes our lives easier. The reason why physics classes seem so hard is not because physics is so hard—it's because we understand so much of it that there's a lot to learn, and that's because it's fundamentally pretty simple.\n— Sean Carroll, The Big Picture\nSimplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better.— Edsger W. Dijkstra\nThe fundamental role of a teacher is not to deliver information. It is guide the social process of learning. The job of a teacher is to inspire, to challenge, to excite their students to want to learn. Yes, they also do explain and demonstrate and show things, but fundamentally that is beside the point. The most important thing a teacher does is make every student feel like they are important, to make them feel accountable for doing the work of learning.— Derek Alexander Muller, https://youtu.be/GEmuEWjHr5c\nWhat is the first business of one who practices philosophy? To get rid of self-conceit. For it is impossible for anyone to begin to learn that which he thinks he already knows.— Epictetus\nConfusion is a feeling that precedes learning something. It means you should pay closer attention, not disengage.— The Stoic Emperor, https://twitter.com/TheStoicEmperor/status/1309998964796567552\nWe don't use heuristics just because they are fast and efficient. We use them because they are less precise and thus less vulnerable to be misled by noise. A good heuristic is to distrust whoever adds or requires unnecessary precision. Another good heuristic is to distrust whoever thinks that precision always correlates with correctness.— Luca Dellanna, https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca/status/1287644735016927234\nLet no one ignorant of geometry enter here.— Said to be engraved on the door of Plato's Academy, the oldest recorded entrance requirement of a college\nThe comments aren't there to explain the code to the programmers, the code is there to explain the comments to the computer.— Andy Harris, How to begin thinking like a programmer, https://youtu.be/YWwBhjQN-Qw?t=1165"
