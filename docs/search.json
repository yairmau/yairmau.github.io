    "text": "Talks\nA scientific talk is not a scientific paper, it is a completely different medium! Here are a few tips that I find useful.\nHow To Give a Talk\n[How To Give a Talk, by David L Stern.]\nExcerpt:\n\nPrinciple 1 - Don’t Put Words On Slides\nIt may not seem intuitive, but including words on slides has a bigger detrimental effect on the quality of a talk than any other issue I will address.\n\n\nThe slides in most science talks contain many words. This simple fact has many consequences, none positive. Most obviously, words on slides impel listeners to read the words on the slide. If you are talking while they are reading, then you generate cognitive dissonance that makes it difficult for the audience to understand either your spoken words or your written words. So, if you want your audience to read the words on a slide, then, presumably, you should shut up. But, I don’t recommend that. Instead, just cut all the words form your slides.\n\nThe David Attenborough Style of Scientific Presentation\n[The David Attenborough Style of Scientific Presentation.]\nExcerpt:\n\nGet into this mindset: your main job is to be an entertainer, not a scientist. Most scientists don’t do this, which is why most scientific talks are bad. The fact of the matter is that if the audience doesn’t understand and enjoy your talk, they won’t care if your science is good.\n\nA LaTeX template\nCheck out a nice LaTeX template for presentations [here].\n\nVisualizations\nVisualizations can take a message very, very far. I put a lot of thinking into how to best express an idea. I believe that great graphs greatly improve a scientific paper, and a thoughful graph/animation surely brings home the main point of a talk. Here are a few thoughts on visualizations.\nInspiration\n\nHans Rosling, Gapminder\nMax Roser, Our World in Data\nStephen Malinowski, Music Animation Machine\nThe Economist, Daily Chart\n\nColors\nDon’t use the rainbow color map.\nWhy? [Read this], by Robert Kosara.\nSo how should you choose the colors for a graph?\n\nVisit colorbrewer. It gives sequential, diverging and qualitative colormaps that can be chosen to be “colorblind safe”, “print safe”, or “photocopy safe”. Usually, it is the first and only tool I use. It’s just great!\nVisit Adobe Color CC. It gives you much more freedom to play with the colors than colorbrewer. Use it wisely!\n\nMore on color: read Subtleties of Color, by Robert Simmon.\nBrowse for ideas\n\nThe Data Visualisation Catalogue"

    "text": "Books\nThe Beginning of Infinity, by David Deutsch\nSo many good things in one book. Sure, at times Deutsch might sound like the proverbial old physicist. A foundational book.\nThe World of Yesterday, by Stefan Zweig\nExcellent first-person account of Europe’s societal and cultural changes, from La Belle Époque to WW2.\nEverything Is Tuberculosis, by John Green\nSuch beautiful prose! You’ll start caring about something you probably never think about.\nChaos, by James Gleick It was probably after reading it as a teenager that I decided to study Physics.\nThe Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914, by Christopher Clark\nIf you like History, read it!\nSiddhartha, by Hermann Hesse\nJust beautiful.\nDebt: The First 5,000 Years, by David Graeber\nNot an easy read; it will crack your head wide open.\nThe World Until Yesterday, by Jared Diamond\nI think about this book a lot. About the many ways the society I live in is just a tiny local minimum in a vast landscape.\nJustice, by Michael J. Sandel\nA superb introduction to Moral Philosophy\nBorn a Crime, by Trevor Noah\nWhen someone who has never listened to (read) an audiobook asks me where they should start, I always recommend this one. Narrated by the author.\nThe Name of the Rose, by Umberto Eco\nI just love Eco, read them all. Start here.\nWaking Up, by Sam Harris\nWhat is the mind? What’s consciousness? Beautiful.\n36 Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction, by Rebecca Goldstein\nGoldstein is a literary genius. I suppose that being Jewish would really help understanding so many of the references in this book.\nThe Unfolding of Language, by Guy Deutscher\nBest linguistics book ever.\nContact, by Carl Sagan\nWhenever I’m asked what’s my favorite book, that’s my answer.\nThe Selfish Gene, by Richard Dawkins\nI read a bunch of Dawkins when I was 16–18. This was eye opening.\nSuperintelligence, by Nick Bostrom\nI didn’t sleep well for three months after reading this.\nInfidel, by Ayaan Hirsi Ali\nShe is a true hero, champion of freedom."

    "text": "Heatwave impact on plants\nHow resilient can plants be to severe heatwaves?\n\n\n\nA warming climate means higher climatic variability, including harsher heatwave events. Severe heatwaves impose great stress on plants, increasing the risk of desiccation and, ultimately, hydraulic failure.\nGuiding questions:\n\nWhat is the relative impact of soil drought and atmospheric drought on plant functioning?\nHow important are water storages (internal and in the soil) in maintaining transpiration and cooling?\nHow do plant resilience and survival chances depend on plant traits?\n\nWe investigate these questions through field and lab experiments with native Mediterranean species, continuously monitoring water fluxes and plant status. We analyze the data using time-series tools and machine-learning techniques. Through mathematical modeling, we investigate plant response to expected future climate.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlant optimal control\nHow can plants best regulate gas exchange, maximizing carbon uptake while minimizing water losses?\n\n\n\nIn order to make photosynthesis, plants capture CO2 from the atmosphere through the pores in their leaves (stomata). However, at the same time that CO2 enters the plant, water vapor exits. If too much water leaves the plant, it will desiccate and die, so the plant should keep its stomata mostly closed. On the other hand, the plant will starve from lack of carbon if it doesn’t open its stomata. We apply the tools of optimal control theory to study this fascinating problem.\nGuiding questions:\n\nWhich plant traits produce different water management strategies (e.g. isohydricity)?\nWhat is the plant really optimizing for? Instantaneous carbon assimilation? Maximum carbon gains over long periods? Fitness?\nHow do plants respond to stochastic environmental conditions?\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFruit-tree water stress\nCan we minimize water stress with smart irrigation scheduling? Can we do it optimally?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSoil salinization\nHow can we ensure healthy soils for generations to come?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSoil compaction\nWhat are the soil physical changes that follow compaction? How do they affect water and solute dynamics, and ultimately soil degradation?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the first business of one who practices philosophy? To get rid of self-conceit. For it is impossible for anyone to begin to learn that which he thinks he already knows.\n— Epictetus"

I started out studying Physics, and then decided to use mathematical tools to understand processes in the critical zone, especially those concerning fluxes of water and carbon in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, both in the natural and agricultural environments.\nI’m interested in understanding how the feedbacks between climate, human stressors, and ecosystems, create interesting environmental dynamics.

    "text": "The scientist is not a person who gives the right answers, he’s one who asks the right questions.— Claude Lévi-Strauss\nThe most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not ‘Eureka!’ (I found it!) but ‘That’s funny…’— Isaac Asimov\nIn theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is.— Jan L. A. van de Snepscheut\nTheory is when you know everything but nothing works. Praxis is when everything works but no one knows why. In our lab, theory and praxis are combined: nothing works and no one knows why.— Unknown\nThe great tragedy of Science — the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact.— Thomas Henry Huxley\nSo, in the face of overwhelming odds, I’m left with only one option, I’m gonna have to science the shit out of this.— Mark Watney\nThe fact that we live at the bottom of a deep gravity well, on the surface of a gas covered planet going around a nuclear fireball 90 million miles away and think this to be normal is obviously some indication of how skewed our perspective tends to be.— Douglas Adams, The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time\nEssentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful.— George E. P. Box\nAn expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.— Niels Bohr\nAn expert is one who knows more and more about less and less until he knows absolutely everything about nothing.— Nicholas Butler\nJust as there are odors that dogs can smell and we cannot, as well as sounds that dogs can hear and we cannot, so too there are wavelengths of light we cannot see and flavors we cannot taste. Why then, given our brains wired the way they are, does the remark, “Perhaps there are thoughts we cannot think,” surprise you?— Richard Hamming\nNothing is more practical than a good theory.— Kurt Lewin\nResearch is what I’m doing when I don’t know what I’m doing.— Wernher von Braun\nThe purpose of models is not to fit the data but to sharpen the questions.— Samuel Karlin\nA theory is something nobody believes, except the person who made it. An experiment is something everybody believes, except the person who made it.— Attributed to Albert Einstein\nContrary to what Asimov says, the most exciting phrase in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not ‘Eureka!’ or ‘That’s funny…,’ it’s ‘Your research grant has been approved.’— John Alejandro King\nYou’d be amazed how much research you can get done when you have no life whatsoever.— Ernest Cline, Ready Player One\nWhen you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.— Sherlock Holmes\nWith four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.— John von Neumann\nThe purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.— Richard Hamming\nThe most important thing about an equation is all the quantities that don’t appear in it; once we know what the essentials are, figuring out how they depend on each other is often the easier part.— Pedro Domingos, The Master Algorithm\nThermodynamics is easy – I’ve learned it many times.— Harvey S. Leff\nFar better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise.— John Tukey, The future of data analysis\nAn article about computational result is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code and data, that produced the result.— Buckheit and Donoho (1995)\n”Forty-two!” yelled Loonquawl. ”Is that all you’ve got to show for seven and a half million years’ work?”\n”I checked it very thoroughly,” said the computer, ”and that quite definitely is the answer. I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you’ve never actually known what the question is.”\n”But it was the Great Question! The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything!” howled Loonquawl.\n”Yes,” said Deep Thought with the air of one who suffers fools gladly, ”but what actually is it?”\nA slow stupefied silence crept over the men as they stared at the computer and then at each other.\n”Well, you know, it’s just Everything … Everything … ” offered Phouchg weakly.\n”Exactly!” said Deep Thought. ”So once you do know what the question actually is, you’ll know what the answer means.”\n— Douglas Adams, The Hitchiker’s Guide to the Galaxy\nComputers are useless. They can only give you answers.— Pablo Picasso\nThe true and only goal of science is to reveal unity rather than mechanism.— Henri Poincaré\nOne of the principal objects of theoretical research is to find the point of view from which the subject appears in the greatest simplicity.— Josiah Willard Gibbs\nThe future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.— William Gibson\nTrue science teaches, above all, to doubt and to be ignorant.— Miguel de Unamuno\nIf you are the smartest person in the room, then you are in the wrong room.— Unknown\nDividing one number by another is mere computation; knowing what to divide by what is mathematics.— Jordan Ellenberg, How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking\nI’ve been in this argument a thousand times. Won them all and convinced nobody.— Amos Tversky, on the hot hand fallacy\nMathematics is the extension of common sense by other means.— Jordan Ellenberg, How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking\nIf I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.— Blaise Pascal\nI am going to give what I will call an elementary demonstration. But elementary does not mean easy to understand. Elementary means that very little is required to know ahead of time in order to understand it, except to have an infinite amount of intelligence. There may be a large number of steps that hard to follow, but to each does not require already knowing the calculus or Fourier transforms.— Richard P. Feynman\nIn this section a mathematical model of the growing embryo will be described. This model will be a simplification and an idealization, and consequently a falsification. It is to be hoped that the features retained for discussion are those of greatest importance in the present state of knowledge.— Alan Turing, The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\nProblems worthy of attack prove their worth by hitting back.— Piet Hein\nArt is solving problems that cannot be formulated before they have been solved. The shaping of the question is part of the answer.— Piet Hein\nPhysics is the simplest of all the sciences, and fundamental physics⁠⁠—the study of the basic pieces of reality at the deepest level⁠—is the simplest of all. Not \"simple” in the sense that the homework problems are easy, but simple in the sense that Galileo's trick of ignoring friction and air resistance makes our lives easier. The reason why physics classes seem so hard is not because physics is so hard—it's because we understand so much of it that there's a lot to learn, and that's because it's fundamentally pretty simple.\n— Sean Carroll, The Big Picture\nSimplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better.— Edsger W. Dijkstra\nThe fundamental role of a teacher is not to deliver information. It is guide the social process of learning. The job of a teacher is to inspire, to challenge, to excite their students to want to learn. Yes, they also do explain and demonstrate and show things, but fundamentally that is beside the point. The most important thing a teacher does is make every student feel like they are important, to make them feel accountable for doing the work of learning.— Derek Alexander Muller, https://youtu.be/GEmuEWjHr5c\nWhat is the first business of one who practices philosophy? To get rid of self-conceit. For it is impossible for anyone to begin to learn that which he thinks he already knows.— Epictetus\nConfusion is a feeling that precedes learning something. It means you should pay closer attention, not disengage.— The Stoic Emperor, https://twitter.com/TheStoicEmperor/status/1309998964796567552\nWe don't use heuristics just because they are fast and efficient. We use them because they are less precise and thus less vulnerable to be misled by noise. A good heuristic is to distrust whoever adds or requires unnecessary precision. Another good heuristic is to distrust whoever thinks that precision always correlates with correctness.— Luca Dellanna, https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca/status/1287644735016927234\nLet no one ignorant of geometry enter here.— Said to be engraved on the door of Plato's Academy, the oldest recorded entrance requirement of a college\nThe comments aren't there to explain the code to the programmers, the code is there to explain the comments to the computer.— Andy Harris, How to begin thinking like a programmer, https://youtu.be/YWwBhjQN-Qw?t=1165"
