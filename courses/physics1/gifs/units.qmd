Any time you pick up a well shuffled deck, you are almost certainly holding an arrangement of cards that has never before existed and will likely never exist again. $52! \approx 10^{68}$. Suppose a new permutation of 52 cards was drawn every second starting from The Big Bang (13.8 billion years ago). You wouldn't even be close. To count out all 52! permutations you would need $10^{51}$ ages of the universe.

If you worked every single day, making $5000/day, from the time Columbus sailed to America, to the time you are reading this tweet, you would still not be a billionaire.

How much larger/heavier/longer was the Megalodon compared with a great white?

This is the mass damper of the Taipei 101 skyscraper: it has a mass of 728 tons and a diameter of 5.4 meters. It helps stabilize the building in high winds and this is the record movement realized during typhoon Soudelor with 160 km/h winds
**what is the mass density of this ball?**
