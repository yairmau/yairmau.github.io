      ”Forty-two!” yelled Loonquawl. ”Is that all you’ve got to show for seven and a half million years’ work?”<br>
      ”I checked it very thoroughly,” said the computer, ”and that quite definitely is the answer. I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you’ve never actually known what the question is.”<br>
      ”But it was the Great Question! The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything!” howled Loonquawl.<br>
      ”Yes,” said Deep Thought with the air of one who suffers fools gladly, ”but what actually is it?”<br>
      A slow stupefied silence crept over the men as they stared at the computer and then at each other.<br>
      ”Well, you know, it’s just Everything … Everything … ” offered Phouchg weakly.<br>
      ”Exactly!” said Deep Thought. ”So once you do know what the question actually is, you’ll know what the answer means.”

There may be a large number of steps that hard to follow, but to each does not require already knowing the calculus or Fourier transforms."

Sean Carroll, The Big Picture:
- title: "Sean Carroll, The Big Picture"
  quote: |
      Physics is the simplest of all the sciences, and fundamental physics⁠⁠—the study of the basic pieces of reality at the deepest level⁠—is the simplest of all. Not "simple” in the sense that the homework problems are easy, but simple in the sense that Galileo's trick of ignoring friction and air resistance makes our lives easier. The reason why physics classes seem so hard is not because physics is so hard—it's because we understand so much of it that there's a lot to learn, and that's because it's fundamentally pretty simple.

The job of a teacher is to inspire, to challenge, to excite their students to want to learn. Yes, they also do explain and demonstrate and show things, but fundamentally that is beside the point. The most important thing a teacher does is make every student feel like they are important, to make them feel accountable for doing the work of learning."

A good heuristic is to distrust whoever adds or requires unnecessary precision. Another good heuristic is to distrust whoever thinks that precision always correlates with correctness."
