## Books

[The Beginning of Infinity, by David Deutsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity)  
So many good things in one book. Sure, at times Deutsch might sound like the [proverbial old physicist](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2012-03-21). A foundational book.

[The World of Yesterday, by Stefan Zweig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_of_Yesterday)  
Excellent first-person account of Europe's societal and cultural changes, from *La Belle Époque* to WW2.

[Everything Is Tuberculosis, by John Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Is_Tuberculosis)  
Such beautiful prose! You'll start caring about something you probably never thing about.

[Chaos, by James Gleick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos:_Making_a_New_Science)
It was probably after reading it as a teenager that I decided to study Physics.

[The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914, by Christopher Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleepwalkers:_How_Europe_Went_to_War_in_1914)  
If you like History, read it!

[Siddhartha, by Hermann Hesse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel))  
Just beautiful.

[Debt: The First 5,000 Years, by David Graeber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5,000_Years)  
Not an easy read, will crack your head wide open.

[The World Until Yesterday, by Jared Diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Until_Yesterday)  
I think about this book a lot. About the many ways the society I live is is just a tiny local minimum in a vast landscape.

[Justice, by Michael J. Sandel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice:_What%27s_the_Right_Thing_to_Do%3F)  
A superb introduction to Moral Philosophy

[Born a Crime, by Trevor Noah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_a_Crime)  
When someone who has never heard (read) an audiobook asks me where should they start, I always recommend this one. Narrated by the author.

[The Name of the Rose, by Umberto Eco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Rose)  
I just love Eco, read them all. Start here.

[Waking Up, by Sam Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_Up:_A_Guide_to_Spirituality_Without_Religion)  
What is the mind? What's consciousness? Beautiful.

[36 Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction, by Rebecca Goldstein](https://www.jewishbookcouncil.org/book/36-arguments-for-the-existence-of-god-a-work-of-fiction)  
Goldstein is a literary genius. I suppose that being jewish would really help understanding so many of the references in this book.

[The Unfolding of Language, by Guy Deutscher](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/262579.The_Unfolding_of_Language)  
Best linguistics book ever.

[Contact, by Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_(novel))  
Whenever I'm asked what's my favorite book, that's my answer.

[The Selfish Gene, by Richard Dawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene)  
I read a bunch of Dawkins when I was 16--18. This was eye opening.

[Superintelligence, by Nick Bostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies)  
I didn't sleep well for three months after reading this.

[Infidel, Ayaan Hirsi Ali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infidel:_My_Life)  
She is a true hero, champion of freedom.
