## About

I'm fascinated by the natural world.
I started out studying Physics, and then decided to use mathematical tools to understand processes in the *critical zone*, especially those concerning fluxes of water and carbon in the **soil-plant-atmosphere** continuum, both in the natural and agricultural environments.

I'm interested in understanding how the feedbacks between climate, human stressors, and ecosystems, create interesting environmental dynamics.
The main topics I deal with include **plant resilience and survival under drought, soil degradation, sustainable resource use**.
Go the to [{{< fa compass-drafting >}} Science page](/science.html) to learn more about some of my current projects, and check out the [{{< fa file >}} Papers page](/papers.html) for details on already published works.

Besides the usual academic pages (Science, Papers, Group, Courses), I hid a lot of material in the [{{< fa magnifying-glass-plus >}} More page](/more): tutorials (python, latex), quotes, recommendations, etc.
